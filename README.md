# Reddit Place: Principle

On april's fool day in 2017, Reddit launched a collaborative project entitled r/place. It consisted of a canvas of 1000x1000 pixels, and each user could only modify one of them every 5 minutes. This lead to the biggest collaborative art project of the world. 
Reddit is organised in topics, and people are grouped in communities. They gathered to try to make their topic appear on the final canva, which led to many overdrawing during the construction of the piece. Our project is to study how people behaved during this experiment and how communities gathered and fought against each other.
