# Biases  & Limitations :
* Bots are more efficient than humans in attacking/defending a piece of art. However this would pose no real problem for our research, as those bots are just enhanced versions of human contribution. The intent of protecting and/or attacking a zone still come from a human decision, wether the user actually does it, or program a bot in order to do it.  

* We take as the absolute truth the "corrected" version of the canvas, in order to decide which pixel are correct or not. It needs to be considered that the correct version only depicts the ideal version at the last moments of the canvas, some artwork evolved during the whole place existence. For example the denmark flag used to have a muche smaller are of occupation until the last day, where this community decided to expand beyond its region. Thus for the denmark flag, part of its existence would be considered as "incorrect" or highly vandalised according to our tools. Fortunately, most of the artworks (would need number to be computed!) from the canvas got their final form pretty early in the existence of r/place, thus diminishing this bias toward this conflict study.


* The way we consider communities conflicts as positive and negative contribution : Communities could have only negative contributor, or separation of roles between attacker and defendant. Such behavior can not be observed with our tools.


* Why we need computational tools to observe conflicts on a website with persistent database : Verbal traces exist of these conflicts, as threads arose on the different subreddits about the subject during the  whole experiment duration. It would be however harder to detect those conflicts out of those threads because 1. it requires filtering out threads about r/place from the others 2. doing some textual classification/processing in order to correctly extract wether a community decided to attack/vandalise another one. (it's definitely not impossible with today ML and NLP techniques, but out of the scope of what we can do for this project)

# Conflicts Type

###_Spatial_
An artwork takes too much place on the canva, thus some communities feel some injustice about the zone repartition. Out of jealousy, they attack the more greedy community.

Examples : Osu, Americanflaginplace

###_Contextual_
One community has some behavioural rules or goals which leads them to override or destroy other artwork.

Examples : theblackvoid, /r/ainbowroad


###_Expansion (Expansional ?)_
One artwork seeks to expand its territory past its preceding boundary, and thus overrides some artwork from other communities.

Examples : Norway over Texas, Germany over France


###_Ideological_
There is an pre-existing ideological difference between two communities that get translated into conflict of vandalism between the two corresponding artworks on the canva.

Examples : Sweden vs Denmark, The_Donald vs TheFarLeftSide

# Ranking of biggest conflicts : 

Note that some entries of the listing are false duplicated, as they occupy the same zone on the canvas, and thus characterizes the same conflict (for example the 8th entry, /r/de and /r/placede are two different subreddits but intrasically linked in a way they defend the same zone, in this case, the german flag)
Also note that included in the ranking are some other interesting conflict which help characterizes big event of r/place's history. (Such as the void destroying of the american flag)

r/sweden attacks r/denmark unilaterally. 384 users with positive contributions to Sweden have negative contribution to Denmark. While in the other way it is only 10 people. Why is this penomenon so unilateral? Sweden has more subscribers, and a bigger area, both seems to imply that more swedes were invested in r/place. Both actual countries have been at war against each other for centuries, but they come to peace since the XIXth century. Still some sort of rivalry and mockery exist between the two nations. This [reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/22aksj/why_do_swedes_and_danes_seem_to_hate_each_other/cgkxdch/) highlights how on the website the mockery/rivalry still exists.

What is interesting however, is when looking at the evolution of the flag, it can be seen that it was temporarily taken over by r/sweden and transformed into the swedish national flag during the first day of r/place. Such a takeover has probably been eased by the similarity of both flags, as they both depict two crossing line of the same color above a uniform background from another color. Only the colors change between the dannish and swedish flag. This means for the average /r/sweden subscriber attacking /r/denmark, he only had to change white pixels of the danish flag into yellow, and red pixels into blue. Thus such

## AMERICAN FLAG IN PLACE

##### R/AMERICANFLAGINPLACE :
SUBCOUNT : Created on the 1st of April, at the end of the experiment, had surpassed 500 subscribers (src : http://redditmetrics.com/r/AmericanFlaginPlace)
##### R/THE_DONALD: (they helped building and defending the flag according to the r/place atlas)
SUBCOUNT : between 385’685 ([31.03.17 - 22h38:51](https://web.archive.org/web/20170331223851/https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/)) and 387’242 ([04.04.17 - 00h12:02](https://web.archive.org/web/20170404001202/https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/))

### VS R/AINBOWROAD :

SUBCOUNT : Created on the 31st of March, at the end of the experiment, had surpassed 5000 subscribers ([source](http://redditmetrics.com/r/ainbowroad))

AREA : 87371.5 pixels

Interesting as both subreddit emerged from the canvas itself. The conflict came largely from the last day of r/place, where the american flag got destroyed by the void, and the rainbow road which was adjacent, took just the newly « blank » place to expand on it (comes from r/ainbowroad philosophy of filling every empty places of the canvas with the rainbow (need source for that)). Once AFIP got back on its feet, it reinstalled the flag at the center of the canvas.

__Reason of conflict__ : Expansion (rainbow road expanding because it was close to it) && contextual (rainbow road took the place to avoid the void keep on expanding)

### VS R/THEFARLEFTSIDE

SUBCOUNT : Created on the 31st of March, at the end of the experiment, had surpassed 1000 subscribers ([source](http://redditmetrics.com/r/TheFarLeftSide))

AREA : 1091.5 pixels

The "far left side", which also stemmed from the canva, is, as its name imply, a zone located on the far left side. However the name also stands for the political orientation, as people of this community are united under ideologies coming from the far left side of the political spectrum (the place they occupied on the canvas is known for having the communist emblem "the hammer and sickle" in yellow above a red background).
According to the table above, they have been attacked by the communities build around the american flag. This conflict might come from the political opposition between this community and r/the_donald, who is famous for hosting many reddit users with far-right ideologies. Even without the implication of r/the_donald, it is reasonable to think that the average american patriotist would be again such a community, as the country has historically always been opposed to communism.

__Reason of conflict__ : Ideological

### VS R/NORGE

SUBCOUNT : 
AREA : 11788.5 pixels

The attack of the americans on the flag from Norway seems to be quite inexplicable, as no real tensions seemed to exist between the two nations, and the place each artwork occupy are far apart so no neighboring expension could explain such conflict. The truth however lies in a information that can not be seen on the raw final result of the canvas. Looking on the r/place atlas, a [small rectangular zone can be highlighted on the center top part of the Norvegian flag](https://draemm.li/various/place-atlas/?id=1302), doing so display the following bit of information :
_"The original location of the Texas flag before Norway's flag expanded and eventually consumed it."_

Thus, it can be safely assumed the american attack was actually an effort into preventing the norvegian flag to override a flag from one of the state from America.

__Reason of conflict__: Expansion


### VS R/PURPLEPIXELS
SUBCOUNT : 
AREA : 3740 pixels

What is purplepixels ? [According to the atlas](https://draemm.li/various/place-atlas/?id=1158) : _"This area was originally black in background, but after /r/purplepixels distanced itself from /r/purplecorner for reasons that caused the purple corner to fall, /r/purplepixels relocated to this area to ensure that purples would be represented on the final canvas."_ The zone it occupies is a small rectangular area around the top left corner, far appart from the american flag. So no obvious reasons for this conflict... Even considering r/purplepixels as the remnants from the purple corner, such corner did never reach the place the american flag would occupy.

__Reason of conflict__: ?

### VS R/IRELAND
SUBCOUNT :
AREA : 10050 pixels

Ireland mainly had a vertically stretched out nationl flag located under the center of the canvas. Integrity over time graphs (would need to show them for both of the countries) shows that the flag of Ireland predated the american flag but took a long time to reach its final form. Inspecting the timelapse shows the ireland flag took a slow ascent to the north until reaching the american flag where it stopped its northern expansion. During the void total annihilation of the american flag, the Irish flag restarted its northern expansion, which was
