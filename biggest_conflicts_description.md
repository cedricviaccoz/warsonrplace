# Biases  & Limitations :
* Bots are more efficient than humans.  	

* The way we consider communities conflicts as positive and negative contribution. Communities could have only negative contributor, or separation of roles between attacker and defendant. Such behavior can not be observed with our tools.

* Why we need computational tools to observe conflicts on a website with persistent database : Verbal traces exist of these conflicts, as threads arose on the different subreddits about the subject during the  whole experiment duration. It would be however harder to detect those conflicts out of those threads because 1. it requires filtering out threads about r/place from the others 2. doing some textual classification/processing in order to correctly extract wether a community decided to attack/vandalise another one. (it's definitely not impossible with today ML and NLP techniques, but out of the scope of what we can do for this project)

# Ranking of biggest conflicts : 

Note that some entries of the listing are false duplicated, as they occupy the same zone on the canvas, and thus characterizes the same conflict (for example the 8th entry, /r/de and /r/placede are two different subreddits but intrasically linked in a way they defend the same zone, in this case, the german flag)
Also note that included in the ranking are some other interesting conflict which help characterizes big event of r/place's history. (Such as the void destroying of the american flag)

## SWEDEN VS DENMARK
##### R/DENMARK :

SUBCOUNT : probably between 71’152 ([31.03.17 - 14h38:52](https://web.archive.org/web/20170310143852/https://www.reddit.com/r/Denmark/)) and 75’470 ([23.04.17 - 17h32:09](https://web.archive.org/web/20170423173209/https://www.reddit.com/r/Denmark/))

AREA : 1012

##### R/SWEDEN :
SUBCOUNT :  probably between 154’586 ([16.03.17 - 10h14:18](https://web.archive.org/web/20170316101418/https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/)and 157’871k([03.04.17 - 00h56:54](https://web.archive.org/web/20170403005654/https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/))

AREA : 18047.5

r/sweden attacks r/denmark unilaterally. 384 users with positive contributions to Sweden have negative contribution to Denmark. While in the other way it is only 10 people. Why so unilateral ? Sweden has more subscribers, and a bigger area, both seems to imply that more swedes were invested in r/place. Both actual countries have been at war against each other for centuries, but they come to peace since the XIXth century. Still some sort of rivalry and mockery exist between the two nations. This [reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/22aksj/why_do_swedes_and_danes_seem_to_hate_each_other/cgkxdch/) highlights how on the website the mockery/rivalry still exists.

__Reason of conflict__: pre-existing conflict




## AMERICAN FLAG IN PLACE

##### R/AMERICANFLAGINPLACE :
SUBCOUNT : Created on the 1st of April, at the end of the experiment, had surpassed 500 subscribers (src : http://redditmetrics.com/r/AmericanFlaginPlace)
##### R/THE_DONALD: (they helped built the flag according to the r/place atlas)
SUBCOUNT : between 385’685 ([31.03.17 - 22h38:51](https://web.archive.org/web/20170331223851/https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/)) and 387’242 ([04.04.17 - 00h12:02](https://web.archive.org/web/20170404001202/https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/))

### VS R/AINBOWROAD :

##### R/AINBOWROAD
SUBCOUNT : Created on the 31st of March, at the end of the experiment, had surpassed 5000 subscribers [source](http://redditmetrics.com/r/ainbowroad)

AREA : 87371.5

Interesting as both subreddit emerged from the canvas itself. The conflict came largely from the last day of r/place, where the american flag got destroyed by the void, and the rainbow road which was adjacent, took just the newly « blank » place to expand on it (comes from r/ainbowroad philosophy of filling every empty places of the canvas with the rainbow (need source for that)). Once AFIP got back on its feet, it reinstalled the flag at the center of the canvas.

__Reason of conflict__ : Spatial (rainbow road expanding because it was close to it) / contextual (rainbow road took the place to avoid the void keep on expanding)

### VS R/THEFARLEFTSIDE

##### R/THEFARLEFTSIDE
SUBCOUNT : Created on the 31st of March, at the end of the experiment, had surpassed 1000 subscribers (http://redditmetrics.com/r/TheFarLeftSide)

AREA : 1091.5

The "far left side", which also stemmed from the canva, is, as its name imply, a zone located on the far left side. However the name also stands for the political orientation, as people of this community are united under ideologies coming from the far left side of the political spectrum (the place they occupied on the canvas is known for having the communist emblem "the hammer and sickle" in yellow above a red background).
According to the table above, they have been attacked by the communities build around the american flag. This conflict might come from the political opposition between this community and r/the_donald, who is famous for hosting many reddit users with far-right ideologies. Even without the implication of r/the_donald, it is reasonable to think that the average american patriotist would be again such a community, as the country has historically always been opposed to communism.

__Reason of conflict__ : Ideological/Pre-existing conflict ?
